# One circuit is created for each of the configured API URL (Base Circuit) & additional circuits are created if configuration are overridden.
# Appropriate circuit is chosen from bottom-up i.e. if for a particular path in API if configuration is overridden, then corresponding circuit with overriden config is applied, else Base circuit is applied)
